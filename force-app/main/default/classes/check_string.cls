        String s = 'In all likelihood, Zach Davies had a good handle on a rotation spot, even after his injury-plagued 2018 season. At this point, his spring training performance has likely locked that up. While results arenâ€™t important in the grand scheme of things, Davies has looked sharp in just about every outing so far -- even more impressive for a guy who has typically struggled to get going in the early season for much of his career. That continued Thursday, with Davies throwing 4 strong innings against the Chicago White Sox, allowing just one run on 4 hits and a walk, striking out 2. The Brewers bats had a hard time getting anything going early, as opposing starter -- and former Brewers draft pick -- Carlos Rodon was very sharp, allowing just 1 hit over 4 innings. The offense picked up in a big way for both teams after the initial out-getters left the game. The Brewers were able to tie the game at 1 when Tyler Saladino homered against his former teammates, but the White Sox got two back in the bottom half of the inning against Angel Perdomo. Jon Freaking Jay gave Chicago the lead back with an RBI single against a drawn-in infield, and then scored later in the inning on a sacrifice fly after Corey Ray made a weak throw that bounced well short of home plate. Chicago added two more runs in the 6th inning against Jay Jackson, who was unable to finish the inning when he loaded the bases after already surrendering an RBI double and RBI single. He was replaced by Bubba Derby, who got out of that inning but did not fare well in the next. In between, the Brewers made a rally, scoring 4 runs in the top of the 7th to tie the game at 5. Manny Pina hit an inside the park home run when former Brewers farmhand Nicky Delmonico crashed into a gate in the left field fence, hitting his head and actually forcing the gate open in the collision. Delmonico remained on the ground and had to be carted off the field before being evaluated for a concussion.';
